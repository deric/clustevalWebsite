The Davies Bouldin Index relates the average distance of elements of each cluster to their respective centroids to the distance of the centroids of the two clusters.

\[ DB = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \sum_{c_i \in C} \underset{c_i \neq c_j}{\text{max}} \left( \frac{\sigma_i + \sigma_j}{d(\bar{c_i},\bar{c_j})} \right) \]
