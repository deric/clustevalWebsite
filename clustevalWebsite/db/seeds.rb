	{program_fullName: 'TransClust/TransClust.jar', program_description: 'Transitivity Clustering is a clustering method based on the assumption that groupings of the data are defined by hidden transitivities between the data objects. The clustering process consists of transforming a given intransitive similarity graph into a transitive one by adding and removing edges. The idea is to find a (clustering) solution with minimal number of edge modifications for the unweighted case. It can also be applied to weighted graphs, where the cost of a solution is the sum of the edge weights that were added or removed.'},
